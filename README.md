### Problem Statement

Autistic individuals often face challenges in understanding and responding to communication due to nuances like tone, intent, and emotional context in text-based conversations. This can lead to misunderstandings and hinder effective communication. The goal is to develop a tool that analyzes text during communication to provide real-time insights, such as emotion detection, intent clarification, and simplified explanations, enabling autistic individuals to engage more confidently and effectively.
